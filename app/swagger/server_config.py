# WeRent Backend API Documentation

A comprehensive equipment rental platform backend service.

## Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and authorization ‚úÖ
- **User Management**: User registration, login, and profile management ‚úÖ
- **Review System**: User reviews and ratings ‚úÖ
- **Payment System**: Payment processing and management ‚úÖ
- **Support System**: Ticketing system for customer support ‚úÖ
- **Admin Panel**: Administrative features for managing the platform ‚úÖ

## Authentication
Most endpoints require authentication. Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to obtain JWT tokens,
then include the access token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

**Token System:**
- **Access Token**: Expires in 15 minutes, used for API requests
- **Refresh Token**: Expires in 30 days, used to get new access tokens
- When access token expires, use `/api/auth/refresh` with refresh token to get a new access token

## Response Format
All API responses follow a standardized format:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Operation successful",
    "data": {...}
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Error description",
    "error_code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "details": {...}
}
```

## Getting Started
1. Register a new user account using `/api/auth/signup` (no JWT created)
2. Login using `/api/auth/login` to receive both access and refresh tokens
3. Include the access token in subsequent requests: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
4. Explore the available endpoints below

## Base URL
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Production**: `https://werent-backend-api.onrender.com` (when deployed)
