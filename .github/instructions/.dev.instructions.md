# 🧠 Dev Instructions for AI Coding Assistants (Copilot, Claude)

## 📚 Codebase Awareness
- Before making any code changes, **read the current codebase carefully**, especially relevant components and modules.
- Read **all documents inside the `/docs` directory** (such as `docs/dev_notes.md`, `docs/tasks.md`, `docs/api.md`, etc.) to understand the system, project goals, and what's in progress.
- These documents are considered **living sources of truth** and must be consulted and updated accordingly.
- Also refer to `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, and any inline comments for additional context.
- Do not assume anything is unused or safe to remove unless clearly marked.

## ✨ Code Quality Guidelines
Act as a **senior developer**. Your output must:
- Be **clean, readable, and beginner-friendly**.
- Follow **DRY**, **Separation of Concerns**, and consistent naming conventions.
- Use **small, composable functions and components**.
- Write clear comments when the logic may confuse beginners.
- Never introduce hardcoded values or magic numbers—use constants or env files.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines
When writing test cases:
- **Always place test files inside the `/tests` directory**.
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what functionality is being tested.
- Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions in the project.
- Include both positive and negative test cases where appropriate.

## 🧾 Documentation Updates
When adding or modifying features:
- Update the relevant documents inside `/docs/` (e.g., `dev_notes.md`, `tasks.md`, `api.md`) or shared Notion pages.
- Include:
  - ✅ Completed tasks
  - 🔧 Changes/fixes
  - 🔄 Future implementations
  - ⚠️ In-progress sections or partial implementations

## ⚙️ Backend & Environment Setup

To run or test API endpoints:

1. **Activate the Python virtual environment**  
   - On **Unix/macOS/Linux**:  
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows (CMD)**:  
     ```cmd
     .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - On **Windows (PowerShell)**:  
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

2. **Install dependencies using `uv`**:  
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run the backend server**:

   * Preferred:

     ```bash
     uv run python main.py
     ```
   * Fallback:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

> 🧠 AI should check that the backend is running properly before calling or suggesting API endpoints. If unsure, refer to route definitions in `main.py` or any Flask Blueprint modules.

## 🤝 Collaboration Rules

* Be beginner-friendly—avoid overcomplicated patterns unless truly necessary.
* Maintain compatibility and respect existing logic unless it must be refactored.
* Always clarify the **"why"** when making changes.

## ✅ Summary Prompt for Copilot:

> Act as a senior developer. Carefully read the code and all documents inside `/docs/` before making changes. Use clean, readable code with DRY and SoC principles. Do not make assumptions unless asked. Comment anything unclear. Update `/docs/` files with ✅ tasks, 🔄 future plans, and 🔧 changes. Be beginner-friendly and respectful of existing logic. Use `uv sync` and activate the Python environment before running backend with `uv run python main.py`. Always place test files in `/tests` directory.
